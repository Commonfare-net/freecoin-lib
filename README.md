# Freecoin-lib - library to facilitate blockchain functions

The freecoin lib is the basic component of the social wallet toolkit. It contains implementations to an interface based on blockchain interactions. It is backed up by mongoDB and it contains one to one interactions, higher level interactions and metadata.

Social wallet (aka Freecoin) is a toolkit to build participatory budget management wallets on top of multiple crypto-currency backends. It is open source and written in Clojure. Freecoin's main use-case is that of developing "social wallets" where balances and transactions are trasparent to entire groups of people to help participatory budgeting activities and organisational awareness.

## Getting started
<img class="pull-right"
src="https://secrets.dyne.org/static/img/clojure.png">

The Freecoin-lib is written in Clojure and is fully
cross-platform: one can run it locally on a GNU/Linux machine, as well
on Apple/OSX and MS/Windows.

### Prerequisites

Install all necessary dependencies, for instance using the following packages found on APT based systems:

```
openjdk version > 7,  mongodb, libversioneer-clojure, haveged, mongodb-server
```

then install Leiningen which will take care of all Clojure dependencies

```
mkdir ~/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein -O ~/bin/lein
chmod +x ~/bin/lein
```

then start the MongoDB server in which Freecoin will store its data:

```
sudo service mongod start
```

### Running

From inside the Freecoin source, start it with

```
lein repl
(start)
```
This is useful for development. For production we have wrapped the base lib in a Swagger API which, the [social wallet API](https://github.com/Commonfare-net/social-wallet-api).

## Running the tests

To run all tests one need to run
` lein midje`
on the project dir

## Deployment

Look at the [social wallet API](https://github.com/Commonfare-net/social-wallet-api)

## Todos

- Implement interfacing with more blockchain endpoints like other than the Bitcoin and its forks.
- Implement interfacing with more DBs like GraphDB.
