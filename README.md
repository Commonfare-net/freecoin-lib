# Freecoin crypto wallet toolkit - core library


[![software by Dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/software_by_dyne.png)](http://www.dyne.org)

Freecoin is a toolkit to build participatory budget management wallets on top of multiple crypto-currency backends. It is open source and written in Clojure. Freecoin's main use-case is that of developing "social wallets" where balances and transactions are trasparent to entire groups of people to help participatory budgeting activities and organisational awareness.

## Design

The design of Freecoin is informed by an extensive economic and user-centered research conducted by the D-CENT project and documented in deliverables that are available to the public:

- [Design of Social Digital Currency (D4.4)](http://dcentproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/design_of_social_digital_currency_publication.pdf)
- [Implementation of digital social currency infrastructure (D5.5)](http://dcentproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/D5.5-Implementation-of-digital-social-currency-infrastructure-.pdf).

More resources can be found on the D-CENT webpage: http://dcentproject.eu/resource_category/publications/

Furthermore, Freecoin's first social wallet pilots are informed by the research made in the [PIE Project](http://pieproject.eu).


## Running the app locally

Install all necessary dependencies, for instance using the following packages found on APT based systems:

```
openjdk-7-jdk mongodb libversioneer-clojure haveged mongodb-server
```

then install Leiningen which will take care of all Clojure dependencies

```
mkdir ~/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein -O ~/bin/lein
chmod +x ~/bin/lein
```

then start the MongoDB server in which Freecoin will store its data:

```
sudo service mongod start
```

then from inside the Freecoin source, start it with

```
lein repl
```
